## Animal Detection

Project created for my mech friends. Wild animal attacks including tiger were increasing in kerala forests. So they built a system with camera and other sensors to detect wild animals in kerala forests.
Wrote the code for them. This code available here is used by them for their project.

Collected 10k images of Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Bear, Wild Boar, Buffalo and labeled them manually in roboflow. Then trained the model using Nvidia 4060 GPU of my friends laptop by installing CuDA.

Their project was in the local news channel.

The code is just single file and you can get things ready by asking AI.
