# Animal Detection

Animal detection in python using YoLo.

This Project was created for my mech friends. The wild animal attacks were frequent in forests of Kerala. So they built a threat detection and alert system with camera and other sensors which detects wild animals and alert the neighbourhood.

I wrote the code for them, and this is the code used by them. We collected 10k image samples of Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Bear, Wild Boar, Buffalo and labeled them manually using roboflow. Then I trained the model with one of my friends Nvidia 4060 GPU by installing CuDA.

As an achievement their project was news in the local news channel.

## Usage

The code is just single file and you can get things ready by asking AI.
